Collectd RPM
============

This is based off the upstream collectd repositories 'contrib/redhat' directory. You can find that source at http://github.com/collectd/collectd

The spec file is based off the latest release (5.2.0) and assumes the EPEL repository is availible. This code is licensed under the GPL version 2 just as collectd is.
